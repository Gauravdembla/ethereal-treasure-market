# üåê How to Access Your Angels On Earth Application

## ‚úÖ Server Status: RUNNING
- **Port:** 8080
- **Status:** Active and responding
- **Environment:** Container/Remote

## üîó Access URLs (Try these in order):

### 1. Container Network URLs:
- **Primary:** http://172.17.0.2:8080/
- **Secondary:** http://172.18.0.1:8080/

### 2. If using VS Code/Codespaces:
- Look for "Ports" tab at bottom of VS Code
- Find port 8080 and click the globe icon
- Or use the forwarded URL provided

### 3. If using SSH/Remote:
```bash
# Run this on your local machine:
ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 your-remote-server
# Then access: http://localhost:8080
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting:

### If none of the above work:
1. **Check your environment:**
   - Are you using GitHub Codespaces?
   - Are you using Docker?
   - Are you using a cloud IDE?

2. **Alternative port:**
   - Try port 3000: http://172.17.0.2:3000/
   - Try port 5173: http://172.17.0.2:5173/

3. **Local setup:**
   - Clone this repo to your local machine
   - Run `npm install && npm run dev`
   - Access http://localhost:8080

## üì± What You Should See:
- Beautiful "Angels On Earth" website
- Purple/lavender spiritual theme
- Navigation with cart and login
- Product grid with crystals and spiritual items
- Responsive design

## üÜò Still Not Working?
Tell me:
1. What environment are you using? (Codespaces, Docker, local, etc.)
2. What error message do you see?
3. Can you see a "Ports" tab in your editor?
