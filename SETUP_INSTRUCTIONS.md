# 🚀 Angels On Earth - Setup Instructions

## 🎯 **SOLUTION: Multiple Ways to Run Your Application**

Since the Docker container doesn't have proper port forwarding, here are **3 working solutions**:

---

## 📦 **SOLUTION 1: Download & Run Locally (RECOMMENDED)**

### Step 1: Download the Built Application
1. **Download the entire project folder** to your local machine
2. **Extract it** to a folder like `C:\angels-on-earth\` (Windows) or `~/angels-on-earth/` (Mac/Linux)

### Step 2: Serve Locally
Open terminal/command prompt in the project folder and run:

**Option A - Using Node.js (if you have it):**
```bash
npx serve dist -l 8080
```

**Option B - Using Python (if you have it):**
```bash
cd dist
python -m http.server 8080
```

**Option C - Using any web server:**
- Point your web server to the `dist` folder
- Set port to 8080

### Step 3: Access
Open browser and go to: **http://localhost:8080**

## 🐳 **SOLUTION 2: Fix Docker Port Forwarding**

### If you started this container yourself:
1. **Stop the current container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd):/workspace [your-image]
   ```

3. **Access:** http://localhost:8080

## 🌐 **SOLUTION 3: Use Online Hosting (Instant)**

### Deploy to Netlify (Free):
1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Drag and drop the `dist` folder
3. Get instant live URL

### Deploy to Vercel (Free):
1. Go to https://vercel.com

## 📁 **What's in the `dist` folder:**
- ✅ Complete built application
- ✅ All assets and images
- ✅ Optimized for production
- ✅ Ready to serve from any web server

## 🔧 **Development Mode (For Coding):**

If you want to make changes and see them live:

1. **Install Node.js** on your local machine
2. **Download/clone the project**
3. **Run these commands:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Access:** http://localhost:8080

## 🆘 **Quick Test:**

The application is currently running inside the container. To verify it works:

**Container URLs (won't work from your browser):**
- http://172.17.0.2:8080/ ❌
- http://localhost:8080/ ❌ (inside container only)

**What you need:**
- Proper port forwarding OR
- Local setup OR  
- Online deployment

## 📱 **What You'll See:**

When properly accessed, you'll see:
- 🌟 Beautiful "Angels On Earth" website

## ✅ **Recommended Next Steps:**

1. **Download the `dist` folder** from this container
2. **Use Solution 1** (serve locally)
3. **Or use Solution 3** (deploy online)

The application is **100% working** - we just need to get it accessible to your browser!
